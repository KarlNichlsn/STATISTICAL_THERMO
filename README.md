Statistical Thermodynamics investigation into the emergence of macroscopic properties 

The macroscopic quantities of a system are the result of microscopic statistical mechanics. This code investigates how an equilibrium is reached between spherical particles with no chemical potential and do not interact with one another, and a piston pushing with a constant force on the particles. The particles obey newtonian mechanics and impart momentum onto the piston with their collisions. 

Over time the distribution of velocities tends toward a normal distribution and the piston tends towards and equilibrium position determined by the force applied.

The evolution of the distribution of particle velocities over time is shown. As well as the similarity of piston position to the ideal gas law.
